File Purposes

Movie.py:
This is the main file that contains the code for both of our classes and our main method. 
Everything will be run through this file. 

movie_data.csv:
This is the file that has our data that we have used for this project. It has various 
information about the top 25 highest grossing movies of all time. We typed it in as 
an excel sheet and copied it as a csv to this project folder. We got all the information from
one website.
